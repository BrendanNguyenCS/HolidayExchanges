1. Think about how to restrict access to certain pages if you aren't the user that the page belongs to

	i.e. bnuge shouldn't be able to edit the other user's profiles and so on

	Same thing for certain buttons on certain pages

2. Input masking for phone fields (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-input-mask-phone-number)

3. Ability to remove a person from a group

4. Ability to have pairings beforehand and manually enter them

5. How do I validate fields for pages that involve AJAX calls?
	- JQuery Validate on client-side
	- Server side validation is a big problem
	- Remote validation? https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/remote-validation-in-mvc-5-using-remote-attribute
	- May involve changing some of the edit views to full viewmodels to avoid validating on User model directly

6. Custom alert boxes with html which jquery can show with the id selector (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)

7. Custom checkboxes/radio buttons (https://codepen.io/jpI/pen/OwgppV)
