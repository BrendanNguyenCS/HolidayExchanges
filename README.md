This is a basic holiday gift exchange application that mainly showcases a Secret Santa "simulator". I want to expand this application by also adding a Yankee Swap simulator in the future.

For anyone who is curious, I have only worked on the logic that works behind the scenes using C# with the appropriate views needed for everything to work. So no CSS styling yet.

Thanks!

Note (March 3, 2024): I am currently looking at upgrading this project from .NET Framework to the more modern .NET Core 8. This may involve creating a whole new solution and then transferring all the logic over.
