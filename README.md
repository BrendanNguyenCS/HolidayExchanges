This is a basic holiday gift exchange application that mainly showcases a Secret Santa "simulator". I want to expand this application by also adding a Yankee Swap simulator in the future.

For anyone who is curious, I have only worked on the logic that works behind the scenes using C# with the appropriate views needed for everything to work. So no CSS styling yet.

Thanks!
